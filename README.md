### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a neuroscience PhD candidate in the labs of Kenneth Harris and Matteo Carandini at University College London. I'm passionate about all things open-source. Check out some of the resources I've developed:

#### For extracellular electrophysiology (especially Neuropixels):
- **Automated quality control:** [bombcell](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/bombcell)
- **Curated Neuropixels resources:** [awesome_neuropixels](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/awesome_neuropixels)
- **Histology tool:** [YAHT: Yet Another Histology Tool](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/YAHT)

#### For anatomical projections:
- **Explore Allen connectivity:**: [neuro_street_view](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/neuro_street_view)

#### For science/academia:
- **Curated science resources:** [awesome_science](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/awesome_science)
- **Prettify MATLAB plots and scripts:** [Prettify MATLAB](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/prettify_matlab)
- **LaTeX PhD thesis template for UCL:** [UCL PhD Thesis Template](https://github.com/Julie-Fabre/LaTeX_PhD_template_UCL)

Feel free to explore these repositories, use them in your projects, and contribute if you have ideas for improvements. Happy coding!
